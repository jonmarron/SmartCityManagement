Smart city management

Following years of analysis, feasibility studies, pre-planning and planning, the mayor's office is ready to start a smart city pilot. You are part of the company that must do the implementation.

The pilot is looking to add two types of devices: "smart waste bins" and "smart lights". The devices all come from different manufacturers, have different model names, serial numbers, number of months they are in warranty and a connection status (connected, warning or error). The devices don't connect to the internet directly, but rather through a gateway. The  gateway has a manufacturer, an address and a list of devices associated with it. A device can only be associated with a gateway if it is from the same manufacturer.

There are two types of smart lights:
LED Street Lights, that have a power of 150W
Halogen Street Lights, with a power of 200W

A waste bin may or may not have a compactor.
As part of general reporting, the city is also interested in getting the following data:
How many devices are installed across all gateways?
What are the devices that have an error in their connection status?
